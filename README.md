nostr-caesar is a policy decision maker for nostr relays.

Given an event, it returns 'true' or 'false' to the relay, instructing it whether or not
to accept that EVENT.

Given a filter, it returns 'true' or 'false' to the relay, instructing it whether or not
to accept that REQ.

This is JUST AN IDEA. No relay supports this yet.
